# Real world prompting course

Welcome to Anthropic's comprehensive real world prompting tutorial. This course is designed for experienced developers who have already dipped their toes into the world of prompt engineering.

Across five lessons, you will learn how to incorporate key prompting techniques into complex, real world prompts. We recommend that you start from the beginning with the [Prompting recap](./01_prompting_recap.ipynb) lesson, as each lesson builds on key concepts taught in previous ones.
